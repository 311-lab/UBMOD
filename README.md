# UBMOD

### Introduction
This repository serves as the source code repository of the Unsaturated zone soil water Balance Model, known as UBMOD. The model a one-dimensional soil water balance model for simulating both downward and upward soil water movement. The model was designed by Wei Mao, Yan Zhu, Tianxing Zhao and Jinzhong yang.
